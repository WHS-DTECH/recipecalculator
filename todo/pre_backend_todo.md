# Pre-Backend Integration TODO

Before connecting the frontend to the backend, complete the following tasks to ensure a smooth integration:

- [ ] Remove unused code, comments, and demo/mock data from all files
- [ ] Ensure all forms and UI elements have unique IDs and clear ARIA labels
- [ ] Document expected data structures and API endpoints (create or update API.md or README)
- [ ] Add placeholder error messages and empty/initial states for all dynamic content areas
- [ ] Validate that all navigation and links work as expected
- [ ] Confirm all static assets (images, icons, fonts) are optimized and referenced correctly
- [ ] Set up a simple mock API or use Mock Service Worker (MSW) for integration testing (optional)
- [ ] Review accessibility with a tool (e.g., Lighthouse, axe)
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and browsers for layout and responsiveness
- [ ] Back up the current frontend code (e.g., git commit)
