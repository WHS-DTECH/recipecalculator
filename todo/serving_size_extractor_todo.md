# Serving Size Extractor TODO List

- [ ] Fix script loading path for serving_size_extractor.js so it loads and runs in the browser.
- [ ] Make extraction strategies dynamic (parse actual raw HTML/text for the selected recipe).
- [ ] Implement backend endpoint for saving solutions (e.g., /api/serving-size/solution).
- [ ] Add error handling for all fetches (e.g., if /api/recipes fails).
- [ ] Move all JS to a separate file for maintainability.
- [ ] Add loading indicators and disable buttons during requests.
- [ ] Add visual confirmation for save/submit actions.
- [ ] Refactor code for modularity and maintainability.
